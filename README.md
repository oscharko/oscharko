## Innovative People Think Differently

I'm a person who wants to understand the world and not just take it for granted: a person who is convinced that the will is stronger than knowledge — for knowledge is still limited. However, it has never been so easy to close the gaps in knowledge — you only need the determination to do so!

I would like to develop and implement solutions instead of simply talking about problems and documenting them, which is why I feel comfortable and at home in an agile environment.

I seek an environment where "Think Different" is wanted and the argument "we've always done it this way" only weighs heavier when it is, in fact, already the best possible solution!

**I'm a crazy one...**

*"Here’s to the crazy ones, the misfits, the rebels, the troublemakers, the round pegs in the square holes… the ones who see things differently — they’re not fond of rules… You can quote them, disagree with them, glorify or vilify them, but the only thing you can’t do is ignore them because they change things… they push the human race forward, and while some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius, because the ones who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do."*

Steve Jobs
